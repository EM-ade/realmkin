# My NFT 3D Viewer - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A complete 3D NFT viewer page similar to Sketchfab that allows users to view their NFTs in an interactive 3D environment.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`/src/components/NFTViewer3D.tsx`** - Core 3D viewer component
2. **`/src/app/my-nft/page.tsx`** - Main My NFT page

## 🎨 Design Features

### Theme Consistency
- ✅ Matches wallet and login page design
- ✅ Dark theme with gold accents (`#DA9C2F`)
- ✅ Amnestia font for headings
- ✅ Same mobile menu overlay pattern
- ✅ Ethereal particles and constellation background
- ✅ Premium card styling with hover effects

### 3D Viewer Features
- **3D Card Display**: NFT images are displayed on 3D cards with depth and gold/rarity-colored frames
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Drag to rotate
  - Scroll to zoom
  - Auto-rotate toggle (pause/play)
  - Responsive camera controls
- **Lighting**: Dramatic lighting with gold-tinted spotlights
- **Environment**: Dark gradient background matching theme

### Page Layout
- **NFT Gallery Sidebar** (left on desktop, toggleable on mobile)
  - Grid of owned NFTs
  - Click to select and view in 3D
  - Refresh button
  - Shows rarity colors
- **Main 3D Viewer** (center stage)
  - Full interactive canvas
  - Control panel at bottom
  - NFT info overlay at top
- **Mobile Responsive**:
  - Gallery as bottom drawer on mobile
  - Touch-friendly controls
  - Full mobile menu integration

## 🎮 User Interactions

1. **Select NFT**: Click any NFT thumbnail in the gallery
2. **Rotate**: Drag with mouse/touch
3. **Zoom**: Scroll or pinch
4. **Auto-rotate**: Toggle with pause/play button
5. **View Details**: NFT info displayed in top-left overlay

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` - Helper components (OrbitControls, Environment, Camera)
- `three` - 3D graphics library

### Data Flow
1. Fetches NFTs from `NFTContext` (already implemented)
2. Auto-selects first NFT on load
3. Creates 3D card with NFT image as texture
4. Applies rarity-based frame colors
5. Renders in interactive 3D canvas

### Fallback Strategy
- **2D NFTs**: Displayed on 3D card with image texture (current implementation)
- **3D Models**: Ready to support GLB/GLTF models (placeholder in code)
- **No NFTs**: Shows empty state with instructions

## 🚀 How to Test

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/my-nft` or click "My NFT" in the mobile menu
3. Connect your wallet
4. Your NFTs will load automatically
5. Click any NFT to view it in 3D
6. Try the controls:
   - Drag to rotate
   - Scroll to zoom
   - Click pause/play to toggle auto-rotate

## 📱 Mobile Support

- ✅ Full mobile menu integration
- ✅ Touch controls (swipe to rotate, pinch to zoom)
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Gallery toggle button on mobile
- ✅ Optimized for portrait and landscape

## 🎯 Navigation Updates

Updated all navigation menus to point to `/my-nft`:
- ✅ Home page mobile menu
- ✅ Wallet page mobile menu
- ✅ Login page mobile menu

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

You can easily add:
- **Screenshot/Share**: Capture 3D view and share
- **AR View**: View NFTs in augmented reality
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Expand viewer to fullscreen
- **Animation Controls**: Play NFT animations if available
- **Rarity Effects**: Add particle effects based on rarity
- **3D Model Support**: Load actual GLB/GLTF models (code is ready)
- **Background Customization**: Let users change viewer background
- **Multiple View Modes**: Grid view, carousel, etc.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **3D Models**: Currently displays 2D images on 3D cards. To support actual 3D models:
   - Add `modelUrl` field to NFT metadata
   - Uncomment GLTFLoader code in `NFTViewer3D.tsx`
   - Update the `has3DModel` check

2. **Performance**: For users with 100+ NFTs, consider:
   - Pagination in gallery
   - Virtual scrolling
   - Lazy loading thumbnails

## 💡 Tips

- The 3D card approach works great for 2D NFTs and gives them a premium feel
- Auto-rotate is enabled by default but pauses when user interacts
- Rarity colors match the existing theme (Legendary = gold, Epic = purple, etc.)
- The viewer is fully responsive and works on all devices
